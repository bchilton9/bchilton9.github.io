The SUDO password is the super user password. Similar to the Administrator account on windows. It is needed to install anything that uses or changes the secure part of the system.
This password can be anything you can remember. If you are not worried about other users tampering with your system you can make it very simple like 1234. Or you can make it more complicated.
<HR>
To set the SUDO password you need to enter Desktop Mode and start Konsole.
<BR>
Konsole is a command line utility that can manage anything in Linux by typing in a command.

<BR>
In Desktop mode you can just press the X button to open the keyboard.

Then in Konsole type:
<BR>
passwd

You will be prompted to ender your password and then enter it again. It will not display anything as you are typing.

The SUDO password is now set.

Remember your password. If you forget it you will have to reset your Steam Deck to factory or there is a complex recovery method creating a bootable USB and booting into a recovery mode. Itâ€™s not a fun process.
