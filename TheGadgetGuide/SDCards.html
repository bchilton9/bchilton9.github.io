<H2>SD Cards</H2>

Depending on the model you have the Steam Deck doesn’t have a lot of storage space. Even the 512gb version will fill up fast with AAA games. Upgrading the internal storage and adding an SD Card will increase your storage space.

The internal storage is much faster than the SD Card storage. If you can only afford one and are willing to open your system and replace the nvme card this is a better option.

SD Cards are still a good option for adding space. Me personally I have done both and I now have 3tb combined storage (2tb internal and 1tb SD card). I place emulated games and older and smaller games on the slower SD Card and save the internal storage for the larger AAA games.

Any drive or card you buy will not get the full space advertised. This is just the way they market them. My 1TB SD card actually has 916.3GB of useable storage.

Selecting a SD card

Warning! There are a lot of fake cards out there. If you find a 1tb SD card on Amazon, eBay or other sites for the $20 to $30 range. It’s fake. They will take a smaller 32gb to 128gb card and format it in a way that it will show up in you computer as 1tb. But if you format it again or start adding files to it you will find out how much space it actually has. If it’s a 32gb card it will stop allowing you to add files after the 32gb is full. If you do get lucky and get one that actually is the size it states it’s probably very poor quality.

Stick with the name brand cards. SanDisk, Samsung, and Lexar are all good brand cards. I personally prefer the Lexar because of the lower price.

Any SD card will work but the smaller cards will fill up fast so I recommend 512gb to 1tb cards.

You also want to look at the speed of the card. The U3 A2 are ideal for the Steam Deck.

Class 10 is the speed of the card. It will have a C with the number 10 inside printed on the card. 10 is the fastest available and it will read at 10MB/sec.

U3 is a faster card. It will read at 30MB/sec. The class 10 is also a U1.

A rating is the read/write speed of the card. An A1 card will play the game the same as an A2 card. But the A2 card will be about 4x faster when downloading a game to the card. Internet speeds will also affect this if you have slow internet speeds the SD card speed will not help with the download. If you have fast internet the A2 card will definitely help with your downloads.

You will need a micro SD form factor for the Steam Deck.

Here is my recommended SD cards for the Steam Deck.

Lexar PLAY U3 A1 1TB
The Lexar cards are the ones I use. They are my number 1 choice because they are less expensive for the U3 A2 cards and I have not had any problems with them.

Top Brand2

SanDisk Extreme U3 A2 1TB
SanDisk has been the top brand for SD cards for a long time. I used to only use them before I switched to Lexar. But they are more expensive.

Now that you have your SD Card it’s as easy as popping it into the slot on the bottom of your Steam Deck. There is a spring in there and it will lock in. If it doesn’t lock in easy it might be backwards. Try turning it around and try again. It will sit flush with the shell.

You should get a pop up from steam to format the card. If you don’t go into Settings > General and click on the format button.

Now when you install a game it will ask you where to install the game to.

Mine says not enough space because Ark is a big game and my Steam Deck is really full. yours will let you select it if there is room.

In your settings under storage it will now have the SD card storage next to the internal storage. You can move games to and from each drive by pressing Y.
