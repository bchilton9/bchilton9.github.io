Plugin: SteamGridDB

SteamGridDB is a Decky Loader plugin to add custom artwork to your games.

To install SteamGridDB open the Decky Loader market search or scroll down to SteamGridDB and click install.


Once the install is complete navigate to the game you would like to change the artwork for and press the three line button (start button) to bring up the option panel. Select Change Artwork.

Alternatively from the game page you can select the settings cog and select change artwork.

Sometimes the option in the menu will disappear. Keep trying to select it. I believe it’s a bug because the plugins are 3rd party.


The options will now load and you can select the artwork you want and press A to select it.

There will be different options for each of the different types of artwork that Steam supports. Capsule, Wide Capsule, Hero, Logo, and Icon. After selecting an icon the plugin will restart Steam to apply the icon. The other artwork does not require a restart.

The manage tab will show you all the current artwork applied to the game.

Pressing X will open the filters. In here you can show and hide artwork types like animated or adult content.

The filters will also let you search for a different name. Handy for 3rd party apps or links with no name or to find different art for other apps. Example: With XIVLauncher. I used a hero from FFXIV instead of the hero from XIVLauncher.
