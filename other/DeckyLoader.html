Decky Loader

Decky Loader is a program for installing 3rd party plugins into Game Mode. There is a lot of QOL and customization plugins available.

Thank you to the Decky Loader team for making this possible.

You will then need to download the Decky Loader installer from there GitHub page here.

It will prompt you for your SUDO password. Enter it and press return. In desktop mode you can just press the X button to open the keyboard.

You will then get a prompt with the installer options. Mine says update to the latest release because I already have Decky Loader installed. Select install the latest release and then click Ok.


Once the install is finished you can click Ok and return to game mode.


In game mode press the three dots button on the right. The bottom icon that looks like a plug is Decky.

On the top right there is the market icon. This is where you install plugins. And there is the settings cog. This is where you can update and uninstall plugins.


To install plugins open the market then simply click the install button on the plugin you want.

When there is a system update the Decky menu can disappear. Most times a system restart will bring it back again. If it doesn’t restart the install process from the beginning and update to the latest release.
