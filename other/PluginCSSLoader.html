CSS Loader is a Decky Loader plugin to customize the theme and layout of your Game Mode Library.

This plugin is one of the best plugins available. You can completely customize your Steam Deck to your liking.


To install CSS Loader open the Decky Loader market search or scroll down to CSS Loader and click install.


Once the install is complete press the three dots button on the right. Select the Decky Loader plug icon on the bottom then select CSS Loader.


On the top right there is a setting cog where you can manage the installed themes. The next icon to the left is the download themes button.

Below that is a Selected Profile drop down menu. This you can use to save and load multiple profile layouts and change them quickly.

Below that is the list of installed themes and a toggle to turn them on and off. Some will have a down arrow that will open more options for the theme.


The download button will open this page with a preview and description of the theme. You can click on the one you want and install it. Then you just need to go back to the previous menu and toggle it on and change any settings to your liking.

There is too many themes and options to list everything here. Play with it. You can always turn off or uninstall themes you don’t like. Some themes will install other themes to add to the look the creator was aiming for.
