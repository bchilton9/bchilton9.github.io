# ChilSoft

ChilSoft is a personal project hub that showcases all my public GitHub repositories in one clean, mobile-friendly interface.

This website:
- Automatically pulls in all of my public repositories via the GitHub API
- Uses custom `description.md` files (like this one) for enhanced repo descriptions
- Separates active and archived projects
- Includes language tags, star count, and last updated info
- Features a Matrix-style animated background for a unique, tech-inspired feel

Built with:
- HTML, CSS (dark theme)
- JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks)
- GitHub Pages for hosting
