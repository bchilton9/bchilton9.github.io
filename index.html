  <h2>Welcome to ChilSoft</h2>
  <p>
  Home to a growing collection of code, tools, tweaks, and digital duct tape. Some of it I built for my home lab. Some of it I built because I was bored. Some of it may have just... happened. It’s mostly open-source, mostly mobile-friendly, and definitely held together by hope and caffeine.
</p>
<p>
  If you find something useful, great! If not, consider it an art installation. Either way, 
  <a href="https://paypal.me/chilsoft?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US" target="_blank" class="donate-link" title="Your coffee helps keep this site 12% less broken.">buy me a coffee… or a Lamborghini</a>. 
  I’ll take it in red. Or matte black. Or a vintage ThinkPad shell filled with jellybeans. I’m flexible.

  Site uptime not guaranteed. Neither is sanity. But hey, at least the matrix background is cool.
